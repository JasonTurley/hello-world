# hello-world

Hello, my name is Jason Turley and I study computer science and anthropology at the University of Illinois.
My goal is to become a systems programmer.

This began as my first GitHub repo! Now it's a collection of *helloworld* files in languages that I know/am learning. 

If you are new to GitHub, use this repo to practice forking and pull requests.
